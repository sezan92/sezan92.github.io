"I remember well how my mother asked me why I couldn't be a nice boy like Wilfred; but I would think to myself that Wilfred, for being so nice and quiet, often stayed hungry. So early in life, I had learned that if you want something, you had better make some noise" - `Shabaz Al Malik` aka `Malcolm X`

## un-m@d's blog
Hello world! I am MD Muhaimin Rahman- nickname is Sezan, working as a Machine Learning Engineer in Japan . I am writing about my open source projects in this blog. 

### What is un-m@d ? 

I am from Bangladesh! In Bengali language উন্মাদ (pronounced unmād) means ***MAD*** . But also if we make un"Mad" , it will become ***Not MAD*** ! So in one sense , ***un-m@d*** means both ***MAD*** and ***NOT MAD*** !! :D
