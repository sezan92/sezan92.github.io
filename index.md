"Because being normal, is too mainstream!"

## un-m@d's blog
Hello world! I am MD Muhaimin Rahman- nickname is Sezan, working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [SEQSENSE Corporation](http://seqsense.com/) , Tokyo Japan .Also I work as a contractor for various other companies! :wink: . I am writing about my open source projects in this blog. 

### What is un-m@d ? 

I am from Bangladesh! In Bengali language উন্মাদ (pronounced unmād) means ***MAD*** . But also if we make un"Mad" , it will become ***Not MAD*** ! So in one sense , ***un-m@d*** means both ***MAD*** and ***NOT MAD*** !! :D
