## K-armed bandit into Markov Decision Process

- In the K-armed bandit problem , all actions are the same. For example in a medical trial, we choose medicine from one of the three. We do not choose like, medicine in one time, and the exercise in the other situation, for example. In the real world, we need to choose different actions for different situations.

- Another situation proposed by the instructor is that the K-armed bandit problem proposes same action for all situations. For example we run the same trial for all patients. Not that we change medicine for different patients.

- Last issue with the K-armed bandit problem is the issue of long term actions.
