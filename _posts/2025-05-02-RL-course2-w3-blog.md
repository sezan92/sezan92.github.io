## TLDR

- TD Learning!

# write down draft from the video.


## TD Learning method.

- TD learning is a combination of Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming.
- It uses the current estimate of the value function to update the value function.
- It is a model-free method.
- It is an off-policy method.
- It is a bootstrapping method.
- It is a temporal-difference method.
- It is a prediction method.
- It is a control method.

### Write Intuition from a real life scenario for TD learning method

Suppose you are a student in the beginning of a semister. The curriculum is not clear yet. How should you study? from the first day? or the last day before the exam? Which day matters most? If we follow dynamic programming.
TODO: continue intuition.
